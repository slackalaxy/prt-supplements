# prt-supplements
Some extra, unofficial, tools to check for dependencies and refresh ports.

## finddepsrow
List port's dependencies as a row.

Output dependencies found by `finddeps` as a single row, suitable for
the "# Depends on:" line in the Pkgfile. Dependencies from core are
omitted. The wrapper also checks if any libs are missing by calling
`revdep`.

## missdeps
Check for missing deps of all packages that are installed.

This tool uses `prt-get listinst` to check for missing dependencies of
the packages that are installed, then reports them and outputs their
immediate installed dependents.

Supplying the `-l|--list` option will output a simple list of missing
dependencies, easy to parse.

## lsopt
This script simply list the optional dependencies for a port.

## pkg-diff
This is meant for systems managed by [pkg-get](https://crux.nu/portdb/?a=search&q=pkg-get) to install prebuilt packages.
A `pkg-get sync` is only aware of packages with changed version/release,
but will not notice those that have been rebuilt, for example after a
`revdep` report for missing libraries.

The tool compares a freshly synced PKGREPO file with a previous copy,
that represents the packages currently installed (or should). The `pkg-diff`
script will output the differences between installed packages found in both.
It will distinguish between packages with a changed version/release and those
that differ only in their .md5sum, for examaple after a rebuild.

At the moment `pkg-diff` does not report new or removed packages in PKGREPO.

To create a snapshot of the current PKGREPO:
```
pkg-diff -s
```

After a `pkg-get sync`, simply running `pkg-diff` will output a verbose report:
```
pkg-diff

-- differences ([u] = updated, [r] = rebuilt)
[u] apr-util
[u] dhcpcd
[u] libinput
[u] libusb
[r] nss
[r] openmpi
[r] pciutils
[r] python3
[u] util-linux
```

To output only the packages that have not changed versions, but have been rebuilt,
do:
```
pkg-diff -lr

nss
openmpi
pciutils
python3
```

## prtskim
This cleans and updates port(s), by running `prtwash`, removing any
`.md5sum`, and updateing footprint and signature. It can be run on a
single port or a collection of ports, e.g. `prtskim *`.

## revlib
Find which ports contain missing libraries needed by a package.

Unlike `revdep`, which will tell you what packages need to be recompiled
after a `prt-get sysup`, this small tool will report which ports contain
missing libraries required by a certain package. 

It is mainly intended for CRUX systems managed `pkg-get`. For example,
I have set the packages I build on my PC as a packages repository for my
laptop. I have generated the repo by `pkg-repgen` where the dependencies
information is extracted from the respective ports. When I install a
package on my laptop with `pkg-get depinst`, its dependencies will be
pulled, however it may have linked to something more present on my build
system. In this case, `pkg-get` will not be aware of such packages,
that are additionally required. It is also useful when updates are done
by `pkg-get sysup`: some packages may have been recompiled against newer
dependencies. These would be automatically upgraded, however their
dependent packages would still have the same version, and thus would be
ignored in the upgrade.

Instead of running every time `revdep` and then hunting the missing
libraries by `prt-get fsearch`, `revlibpkg` aims to automate things a
bit.

The ports database (and hence .footprints) should be updated for this to
work properly.
